# üè° Household Energy Consumption Analysis & Dashboard

## üìå Introduction

The **Household Energy Consumption Analysis** project aims to analyze energy usage patterns across various households and provide actionable insights for improving energy efficiency. The dataset consists of 188 households with attributes such as dwelling type, household size, heating sources, education index, income levels, energy efficiency class, and daily energy consumption (kWh/day).

Using **Python (Machine Learning)** and **Power BI**, this project provides:

* Predictive modeling of household energy consumption
* Segmentation of households using clustering
* An interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization and decision-making

## üéØ Objectives

* **Data Cleaning:** Standardize column names, handle missing values, and ensure data consistency.
* **Feature Engineering:** Convert categorical and numerical variables for model training.
* **Machine Learning:** Build a regression model to predict `kWh/day` consumption.
* **Clustering:** Segment households based on energy usage patterns.
* **Visualization:** Create a Power BI dashboard to communicate insights clearly.
* **Innovation:** Enhance predictions using ensemble techniques and provide interactive analytics.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

* **Total Rows:** 188 households
* **Total Features:** 38 columns
* **Key Columns:**

  * **House Characteristics:** `dwelling`, `dwelling_grade`, `household_m2`, `bedrooms`, `heating_source`
  * **Demographics:** `occupants`, `children`, `teenagers`, `adults`, `elders`
  * **Socioeconomic:** `income`, `education_index`, `recycling`, `awareness`
  * **Energy Metrics:** `energy_class`, `thermostats`, `smart_plugs`, `water_heater`, `kwh/day`, `hdd`, `cdd`
  * **Time Metrics:** `start`, `end`, `days`

## üîß Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

1. **Normalized column names** for consistency
2. **Removed empty rows** and placeholder headers
3. **Handled missing values** via imputation or row removal
4. **Converted income strings to numeric values**
5. **Encoded categorical variables** for machine learning models
6. **Standardized numeric features** using `StandardScaler`

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Implementation

* **Model Used:** `RandomForestRegressor`
* **Features:** 11 numeric + 9 categorical variables
* **Target:** `kwh/day`
* **Evaluation Metrics:**

  * **RMSE:** 7.05
  * **R¬≤ Score:** 0.27

Although the R¬≤ score is moderate, the model successfully captures baseline consumption patterns and can be improved further with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

## üîç Clustering Approach

* **Algorithm:** `KMeans`
* **Number of Clusters:** 4
* **Features Used:** Household size, demographics, income, education, and `kwh/day`
* **Result:** Segmented households into low, moderate, high, and extreme energy consumers
* **Visualization:** Scatter plot showing clusters based on `income` vs. `kwh/day`
